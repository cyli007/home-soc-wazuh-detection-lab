Home SOC Lab – Detection Engineering with Wazuh
1. Project Objective
This project was built to simulate a realistic Windows credential compromise scenario within a controlled home SOC environment using Wazuh SIEM.

The goal was not just to generate alerts, but to understand how raw Windows authentication logs are collected, parsed, correlated, and transformed into high-confidence security detections.

The lab models attacker behavior across multiple stages, including brute-force login attempts, successful authentication after repeated failures, and privilege escalation through local administrator group modification.

By engineering custom correlation rules and validating detections against raw Windows event logs, this project demonstrates practical detection engineering, rule tuning, and attack timeline reconstruction inside a SIEM.
